/**
 * Gives every test a freshly instrumented browser and, when the test is done, fails it if
 * the browser saw anything broken.
 *
 * <p>Declared once on {@link RollerIT}, so the whole suite inherits the checks and no
 * individual test has to remember to ask for them.
 *
 * <p><b>The browser is kept for the whole test CLASS, not for one test.</b> It used to be
 * closed in {@link #afterEach}, so a Chrome and a chromedriver were launched and torn down
 * once per test METHOD -- 126 times over a full suite -- and, because the session cookie
 * died with the browser, that in turn forced 21 of the 36 IT classes to sign in from
 * {@code @BeforeEach} rather than {@code @BeforeAll}. The cost was measurable:
 * {@code RouteSweepIT} spent 4.0s per test on a body that opens one URL and asserts one
 * CSS selector.
 *
 * <p>Keeping the PROCESS while resetting the SESSION is what makes that safe, and the two
 * hazards that used to justify a fresh browser are both handled explicitly in
 * {@link BrowserHealth#attach} instead: DevTools listeners are cleared before new ones are
 * registered (they would otherwise accumulate on a reused session and double-count
 * events), and cookies and web storage are cleared over CDP (a surviving login cookie
 * would let a test pass on the previous test's session instead of establishing its own).
 * What is reused is the process; the state is not.
 *
 * <p>Sharing a browser across the methods of one class is consistent with what this suite
 * already declares about itself in {@code junit-platform.properties} -- a class here is "a
 * narrative ... whose methods share fixtures built in {@code @BeforeAll}" and its methods
 * run {@code same_thread}. Selenide's WebDriver is thread-local, so class-parallel workers
 * still get a browser each.
