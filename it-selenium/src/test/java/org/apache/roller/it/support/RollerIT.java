     * the 302 proves the credentials and the session, and {@code installCookie} now checks
     * CDP's own success flag, which is the only place a refused cookie is ever reported. What

     * different moments. {@code BrowserHealthExtension.afterEach} calls
     * {@code BrowserHealth.detach()} after every test, which clears the

     * those two points {@link #openPath} has a browser to drive but
     * {@code BrowserHealth.current()} throws. This re-attaches a recorder for
     * the duration of {@code work} and detaches it again.
     *
     * <p>Use it for class-level fixture teardown that has no HTTP equivalent
     * -- deleting a weblog, for instance, which the automation API cannot do.
     * Assertions made inside {@code work} are ordinary assertions; the
     * recorder is here so the navigation helpers function, not to add a
     * health verdict to a class that has already finished reporting.
     *
     * <p>A no-op when no browser was ever started (every test in the class was
     * skipped, say), rather than starting one just to close it.
