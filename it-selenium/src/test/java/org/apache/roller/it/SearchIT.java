/**
 * Search, from writing a post to a reader finding it.
 *
 * <p>Nothing proved search actually worked. The public surface test opens the
 * search page and checks it renders, which it would do just as happily with a
 * broken index behind it -- and the index is a separate store that can drift
 * from the database without anything failing. That mattered the moment Lucene
 * went from 9 to 10.
 *
 * <p>The two directions are both worth holding. An entry that is published and
 * cannot be found is a feature quietly not working; an entry that is deleted
 * and can still be found is worse, because the result links to a page that no
 * longer exists. The second is why entry deletion goes through
 * {@code trashEntryWithIndex} rather than a plain delete.
 *
 * <p>Indexing is asynchronous, so every assertion here polls rather than
 * checking once: the alternative is a test that passes or fails on how busy
 * the machine is.
