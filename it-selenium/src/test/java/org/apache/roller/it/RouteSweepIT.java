/**

 * <p>Reachability sweeps usually degrade into "did it return 200", which is
 * worthless here. Roller's tabbedpage layout supplies a banner, a navigation
 * menu, a footer and an {@code <h1 class="roller-page-title">} regardless of
 * what the content tile contains, so {@code categoryEdit.rol} -- whose content
 * tile is wired to empty.jsp -- returns a perfectly healthy-looking 200 with no
 * form on it. Every route therefore asserts a marker that only its own content
 * tile emits; see {@link Routes} for the per-route selector and why each was
 * chosen.
 *
 * <p>Routes already known to be broken live in {@link #knownBrokenRoutesAreStillBroken()},
 * which asserts they fail. Fixing one of them turns that test red, which is the
 * point: the fix cannot land without moving the route into the sweep proper.
 *
 * <p>Console errors and 404ing sub-resources are checked by the
 * BrowserHealthExtension that {@link RollerIT} registers -- this class does not
 * repeat that work.
