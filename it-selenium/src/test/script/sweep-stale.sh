# Pre-run sweep: reap what earlier IT runs leaked, and SAY SO.
#
# Runs first in pre-integration-test, before the postgres container starts, so
# whatever a Ctrl-C or an aborted build left behind is gone before this run
# adds to it. That bounds accumulation to one run's worth.
#
# Saying so is half the fix. build-helper reserves a *free* port every run, so
# a leaked app server holding a port never collided with anything and the next
# run started perfectly cleanly -- which is how four Roller JVMs and thirteen
# chromedrivers accumulated on a developer machine without one failing build.
# The leak was never the silent part; the silence was.
#
# Staleness is decided by the owning build, never by "an IT process exists": a
# second, concurrent `mvn verify -Pit` is legitimate (that is what the random
# port reservation is for) and its processes must survive this sweep. A process
# is stale only when the Maven build named by its owner token is gone.
#
# Usage: sweep-stale.sh <current-run-id> [work-dir]
# Environment:
#   IT_WORK_DIR      overrides <work-dir>
#   IT_RECORD_DIR    overrides where chromedriver records are read from
#                     (default: ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/roller-it) --
#                     tests only.
#   IT_SWEEP_STRICT  set to 1 to fail the build when anything was reaped,
#                    rather than warning loudly (default: warn)

# ---------------------------------------------------- their chromedrivers

# Chromedrivers cannot be identified after the fact -- once the failsafe JVM
# that spawned them dies they reparent to init and look like anyone else's.
# The supervisor records them by pid, stamped with its owning build's
# identity (it_record_init), in IT_RECORD_DIR -- a location `mvn clean`
# cannot reach (see it-harness-lib.sh), so the record survives even a run
# whose app AND supervisor have BOTH already exited. That run contributes
# NOTHING to STALE_RUNS above, which is built entirely from live marked
# processes: this is deliberately a second, independent pass over every
# record found on disk, not a lookup keyed off STALE_RUNS.
#
# Every record is judged purely by its own header, never by whether some
# other process happens to still exist:
#   - owner alive  -> skip the record entirely, untouched. Non-negotiable:
#                      a second, concurrent `mvn verify -Pit` is legitimate
#                      (CLAUDE.md), and its drivers must survive this sweep
#                      no matter what the process-marker pass above decided.
#                      An owner token this library did not recognise (no
#                      header, or an unparseable one) is treated the same
#                      way -- refuse to guess, the same rule it_owner_alive
#                      itself follows for an unresolvable start time.
#   - owner dead   -> reap the recorded pids, re-checking each is STILL a
#                      chromedriver (pids recycle) and killing its
#                      descendants too -- SIGKILL to chromedriver does not
#                      take its Chrome children with it, which is where a
#                      reaped run's memory actually sits -- then delete the
#                      record either way, so an empty record or one whose
#                      pids have all already exited cannot linger forever.
