# Works from the run id, not only from the pidfile. A pidfile is a hint that may
# be missing (the app never started), stale (the pid has been recycled) or --
# the case that actually bit -- overwritten, back when every run wrote the same
# app.pid and run N+1 destroyed the only record of run N's leaked JVM. The run
# marker on the process's own command line cannot be lost that way, so the
# pidfile is now belt and the marker is braces.

# Usage: stop-app.sh <pidfile> <run-id>
