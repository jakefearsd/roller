#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Ties one IT run's processes and container to the lifetime of the Maven build
# that owns them, rather than to the build reaching post-integration-test.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Failsafe's split-goal design already protects cleanup from
# *test* failures: integration-test records them, verify fails the build later,
# post-integration-test runs in between. What it cannot protect against is an
# *infrastructure* failure earlier in pre-integration-test -- pg-wait-ready
# timing out, migrate.sh failing, the seed failing, app-start timing out -- or a
# Ctrl-C. Any of those aborts the build before post-integration-test exists,
# taking every cleanup step with it. This supervisor starts before all of them
# and outlives the build, so the run is cleaned up by something whose own
# survival does not depend on the build's.
#
# It is a detached poller, not a systemd scope. `systemd-run --user --scope`
# would give a killable-by-name unit, but it needs a user D-Bus session that
# is not reliably present on CI runners or in containers, it does not exist on
# macOS, and a scope does not actually die with its invoking process -- so it
# would add a platform dependency and still need this polling loop underneath.
# setsid plus an ignored SIGINT is portable to anything with a POSIX shell.
#
# Usage: supervise-run.sh <run-id> <container-name> <work-dir>
# <work-dir> is used only for this run's own log file; the chromedriver
# attribution record lives elsewhere (IT_RECORD_DIR, see it-harness-lib.sh)
# precisely because <work-dir> is target/, which `mvn clean` deletes.
# Environment:
#   IT_OWNER_STAMP  owner token to watch (default: computed from $PPID, which
#                   under maven-antrun-plugin is the Maven JVM)
#   IT_POLL_SECONDS how often to check on the build (default: 3)
#   IT_RECORD_DIR   overrides where the chromedriver record is written
#                   (default: ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/roller-it) --
#                   tests only; never point this at target/ or /tmp.
