# Starts the executable Roller WAR for the browser IT suite and blocks until
# it answers, or fails with the app log tail for diagnosis -- killing what it
# started on every failure path.
#
# Replaces cargo's Tomcat deploy + pingURL wait: same readiness contract
# (poll roller-ui/login.rol, 180s budget), against the actual Boot-executable
# WAR instead of an exploded WAR under an external Tomcat.
#
# THE TRAP IS THE POINT. This runs in pre-integration-test, so a non-zero exit
# here aborts the build *before* post-integration-test -- the phase where
# app-stop lives. Exiting without killing the JVM it had just started therefore
# leaked it permanently, and the readiness-timeout path did exactly that. Every
# exit from this script now goes through cleanup().
#
# Usage: start-app.sh <war> <port> <custom-config-properties> <pidfile> <log> <run-id>
#
# Environment (all optional):
#   IT_APP_JAVA               java command to launch with (default: java)
#   IT_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS  readiness budget (default: 180)
#   IT_OWNER_PID              build process that owns this app (default: $PPID,
#                             which under exec-maven-plugin is the Maven JVM)
#   IT_CONTEXT_PATH           bare context segment the app is deployed under,
#                             e.g. "roller". EMPTY (the default) means the
#                             root, which is what the app itself defaults to --
#                             the suite tracks the shipped default rather than
#                             pinning a prefix production does not use.
#                             `mvn verify -Pit -Dit.context.path=roller` runs
#                             the whole suite under a prefix instead, which is
#                             the only end-to-end coverage of that case.
