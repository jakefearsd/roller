/**
 * One invariant, over every Velocity resource loader this application
 * configures: <b>a loader that cannot report modification may not be
 * cached.</b>
 *
 * <p>The pairing is not decorative, and getting it wrong is invisible. With
 * caching on, Velocity asks {@code isSourceModified} whether its parse tree
 * is stale and reuses it whenever the answer is no. A loader that answers
 * "no" unconditionally therefore pins every template it ever loaded for the
 * life of the JVM: editing one does nothing at all until a restart, with no
 * error anywhere, on a screen whose whole purpose is editing templates.
 *
 * <p>This has been live in both directions. {@link ThemeResourceLoader} used
 * to hardcode {@code isSourceModified() -> false} and
 * {@code getLastModified() -> 0}, which is exactly why
 * {@code resource.loader.theme.cache} had to be {@code false}, which in turn
 * cost a full re-read and re-parse of every theme template on every request
 * in production. Making that loader honest is what let its cache be turned
 * on. {@link RollerResourceLoader} is the half that did NOT change: it serves
 * custom templates from the database and still answers
 * {@code isSourceModified() -> false} unconditionally, so its cache must stay
 * off, and until this test the only thing standing between that and
 * silently-broken custom-template editing was one unremarked line in
 * velocity.properties.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately behavioural rather than a config-to-config comparison: it
 * probes what each cached loader actually answers, so a NEW loader that
 * arrives with the same trap is caught by the same test, and a loader later
 * taught to report modification honestly is free to enable its cache without
 * anyone editing a list here.
