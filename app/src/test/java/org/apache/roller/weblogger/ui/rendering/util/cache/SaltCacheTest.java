/**
 * Tests the cache of XSRF salt values.
 *
 * Unlike the other caches here this one is not an optimisation: a salt that
 * cannot be found again is a form post that gets rejected, and a salt that
 * outlives its window is one an attacker has longer to replay. It is also the
 * one cache that must be shared across a cluster, which is why it goes through
 * the CacheManager rather than a plain map.
