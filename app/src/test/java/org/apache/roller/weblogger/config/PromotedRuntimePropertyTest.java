/**
 * The properties promoted from startup-only to runtime-settable.
 *
 * <p>These three used to be readable only from {@code roller.properties}, which
 * meant the only way to exercise the other branch of any of them was to restart
 * the server with a different file. They now live in
 * {@code runtimeConfigDefs.xml} as well, so one running instance can be
 * reconfigured across all of them -- which is what lets the browser suite cover
 * these permutations without a second boot.
 *
 * <p>Promotion puts a property name in two files at once, and that is the
 * hazard these tests exist for. The database row wins once it exists, so a
 * drifting default would give a fresh install and an upgraded one different
 * behaviour from identical configuration, and a naive seeding would throw away
 * whatever the deployer had set in {@code roller-custom.properties}.
