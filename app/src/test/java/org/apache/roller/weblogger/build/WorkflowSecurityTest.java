/**
 * Supply-chain invariants for the GitHub Actions workflows.
 *
 * <p>These files are the one part of this repository that <em>cannot</em> be
 * exercised locally: {@code release.yml} runs only on a {@code v*.*.*} tag
 * push, so its first execution after any edit is a real release that publishes
 * container images publicly. A static check is therefore worth more here than
 * it would be for ordinary code -- it is the only feedback available before
 * the consequences are irreversible.
 *
 * <p>What it pins, and why each matters:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Third-party actions are pinned to a commit SHA.</b> A major-version
 *       tag like {@code @v3} is mutable: whoever owns it can move it, and the
 *       next workflow run executes whatever it points at then. First-party
 *       actions ({@code actions/}, {@code github/}, {@code docker/}) are
 *       exempt as a deliberate trust decision -- they are owned by the same
 *       parties that own the runner and the registry, so pinning them buys
 *       nothing that compromising GitHub itself would not already defeat.</li>
 *   <li><b>Every workflow declares {@code permissions}.</b> Omitting it inherits
 *       the repository default, which is a setting no reviewer of the file can
 *       see and which an administrator can change without touching this repo.
 *       The default is read-only today; this keeps that true by assertion
 *       rather than by luck.</li>
 *   <li><b>The release is published by the GitHub CLI, not an action.</b> That
 *       step runs in the only job holding {@code contents: write} plus
 *       {@code packages: write}, with a live GHCR credential in scope. A SHA
 *       pin would freeze that risk; using {@code gh} removes the third party
 *       altogether. Reintroducing an action there should be a deliberate,
 *       visible act, not a convenience refactor.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Sibling of QualityGatePomTest, ProductionComposeTest, ItHarnessPomTest and
 * DependencySecurityFloorTest.
