/**
 * Tests the wrapper that gives a cached object a lifetime.
 *
 * This is what the expiring caches and the XSRF salt cache lean on: a salt that
 * outlives its window lets a stale form post through, and a page that outlives
 * its window is served to readers after it should have been re-rendered. The
 * exact boundary therefore matters, so these tests state the creation time
 * rather than reading it off the wall clock.
