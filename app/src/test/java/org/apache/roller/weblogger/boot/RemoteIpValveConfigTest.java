/**
 * Pins the two {@code server.tomcat.remoteip.*} keys in {@code
 * application.properties} that install Tomcat's {@code RemoteIpValve}.
 *
 * <p>There is no {@code @Bean} for this, unlike {@link WebContainerConfig}'s
 * error pages and welcome files -- Spring Boot's {@code ServerProperties}
 * auto-configuration wires the valve straight from these two keys, so there
 * is no Java-config seam to unit test against directly (an end-to-end proof
 * would need a real embedded Tomcat behind a proxy sending X-Forwarded-For,
 * which is what {@code docker_deployment.md}'s TLS section and the property
 * comments describe instead). This test instead pins the properties file
 * itself, on the {@code WebContainerConfigTest} family's "prose is not proof"
 * principle: a key silently dropped or renamed during a future edit would
 * otherwise collapse every per-client throttle onto Caddy's own address in
 * production with nothing failing red locally.
 *
 * <p>{@code server.forward-headers-strategy=framework} (Spring's own {@code
 * ForwardedHeaderFilter}, tested end-to-end in {@code InitFilterTest}'s
 * forwarded-proto chain) is a DIFFERENT mechanism: it rewrites {@code
 * getScheme()}/{@code isSecure()}/{@code getRequestURL()}, never {@code
 * getRemoteAddr()}. The RemoteIpValve keys pinned here are what makes
 * {@code getRemoteAddr()} -- and therefore every throttle keyed on it --
 * proxy-aware.
