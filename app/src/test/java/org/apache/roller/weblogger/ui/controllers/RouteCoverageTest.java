/**
 * Fails when a controller grows a GET route that the browser reachability sweep
 * does not know about.
 *
 * <p>The sweep lives in the it-selenium module and only runs under
 * {@code mvn verify -Pit}, which costs minutes and needs Docker and a browser.
 * That is the wrong place to notice that a new page was never added to it, so
 * the bookkeeping half of the job lives here instead and runs in every
 * {@code mvn test}: enumerate the {@code @GetMapping} paths the controllers
 * actually declare, and check each one appears in the sweep's catalogue --
 * either as a route it visits, a route skipped with a written reason, or a
 * route recorded as broken. Adding a page to the UI without deciding which of
 * those three it is now fails the build.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this reads a file instead of importing the catalogue.</b> The app
 * module must not depend on an integration-test module -- that would make the
 * ordinary build need the IT module's Selenide and Selenium dependencies, and
 * invert the reactor (it-selenium already depends on the app WAR). So this test
 * reads {@code Routes.java} as text and pulls the route literals out with a
 * regex, exactly as {@link org.apache.roller.weblogger.ui.WebjarReferenceTest}
 * reads JSPs to check the webjar URLs written into them. The alternative --
 * keeping a second copy of the list here -- would drift, and a coverage guard
 * that drifts is worse than none. The cost is a formatting rule: route paths in
 * Routes.java have to be plain {@code "/roller-ui/..."} string literals rather
 * than assembled from constants. That rule is stated at the top of Routes.java.
