/**
 * Test fixture: sets one key of the static {@link WebloggerConfig} -- the
 * layer a {@code ROLLER_*} environment variable lands in, since
 * {@code applyEnvironmentOverrides} writes into it once per JVM -- for the
 * duration of a try-with-resources block, and on close puts back exactly what
 * was there before, absence included.
 *
 * <p>The static config is process-global and has no general setter, so this
 * reaches its {@code Properties} reflectively, the way several single-class
 * helpers in this suite already do. Restoring rather than clearing is the
 * point: a key left behind would leak into every later test in the JVM, the
 * same shape as the global absolute-URL pollution that once made CI
 * order-dependent.
