/**
 * Security floors for third-party libraries carrying published advisories.
 *
 * <p>This test asserts the version that actually <em>resolves onto the
 * classpath</em>, not the text of a {@code pom.xml}, and that distinction is
 * the entire reason it exists. {@code app/pom.xml} <em>imports</em>
 * {@code spring-boot-dependencies} as a BOM ({@code <scope>import</scope>})
 * rather than inheriting from {@code spring-boot-starter-parent}. Under an
 * import, a {@code <properties>} entry in the importing POM does <strong>not
 * </strong> override the BOM's managed version -- the BOM's properties are
 * resolved in the BOM's own context. So the obvious way to raise a
 * Boot-managed version here is silently a no-op: the property sits in the POM
 * looking authoritative while the vulnerable jar keeps resolving. Overriding
 * therefore has to be done with explicit {@code <dependencyManagement>}
 * entries declared <em>before</em> the BOM import (nearest/first declaration
 * wins), and only a resolved-classpath assertion can tell the two apart.
 *
 * <p>The second failure mode this guards is a future Spring Boot upgrade.
 * These overrides exist only because Boot 4.1.0's BOM pins versions that are
 * now behind their advisories; when a later Boot catches up, the natural
 * cleanup is to delete the override and let the BOM manage it again. That is
 * correct exactly when the BOM's version is at or above the floor, and a
 * silent reintroduction of the CVE when it is not. Deleting an override is
 * safe here precisely because this test will fail if it was premature.
 *
 * <p>Floors only ever move up, like the JaCoCo ratchet in the parent POM.
 * Sibling of QualityGatePomTest, ItHarnessPomTest and ProductionComposeTest.
