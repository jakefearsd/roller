/**
 * Tests the entry wrapper behind the weblog page and feed caches.
 *
 * Rather than hunting through the cache for the entries belonging to a weblog
 * whenever that weblog changes, those caches record when the weblog was last
 * modified and compare it against the entry on the way out. That comparison is
 * the whole invalidation mechanism for every blog page Roller serves: if it
 * goes the wrong way, readers keep seeing a deleted post, or every page misses
 * the cache forever.
