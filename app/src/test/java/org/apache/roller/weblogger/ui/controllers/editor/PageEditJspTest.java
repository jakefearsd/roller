/**
 * Source scans over the page editor's markup, and over the two includes that
 * make it the <em>same</em> editor the entry screen runs.
 *
 * <p>The page editor was a Bootstrap grid form with its own minimal editor
 * mount, its own copy of the upload script, and no toolbar, mode control,
 * preview, guide or status line. Everything an author does to a page is
 * therefore either identical to the entry editor or a defect -- so the
 * markup and the script are single-homed in
 * {@code EditorSurface.jsp}/{@code EditorScript.jsp} and both screens include
 * them. A copy is what these scans exist to prevent: nothing about a second
 * copy of the editor fails loudly, it simply drifts.
 *
 * <p>Each scan reads the JSP because none of this can fail at compile time,
 * the same reasoning {@code EditorAutosaveWiringTest} and the
 * {@code _showInNav} marker check in {@link PageEditControllerTest} give.
