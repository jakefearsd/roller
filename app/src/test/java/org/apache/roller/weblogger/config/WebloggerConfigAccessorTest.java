/**
 * How the static config accessors answer, including when they are asked for
 * something that is not there or is not the type asked for.
 *
 * <p>The typed accessors disagree with each other about malformed input, and
 * that disagreement is pinned here deliberately rather than smoothed over: a
 * property that is not a boolean reads as {@code false} and says nothing,
 * while a property that is not an int throws out of whatever was starting up
 * at the time. Both are defensible on their own -- silently defaulting is
 * friendlier, failing fast is safer -- but a reader who knows one and assumes
 * the other will be wrong. Changing either is a behavioural decision, not a
 * cleanup, so these tests describe what is rather than what might be nicer.
 *
 * <p>The assertions establish their own preconditions from the live config
 * rather than hard-coding values from {@code roller.properties}, so that
 * retuning a default cannot quietly turn one of these into a test of nothing.
