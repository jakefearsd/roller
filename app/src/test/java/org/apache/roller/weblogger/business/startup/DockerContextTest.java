 * {@code frontend-maven-plugin} produces under {@code app/frontend/}.
 *
 * <p>{@code Dockerfile} COPYs the whole {@code app/} tree into the builder
 * stage, and {@code .dockerignore} only ever excluded {@code app/target/}.
 * On a dev checkout that already has {@code app/frontend/node/} (the pinned
 * Node runtime the plugin downloads, ~138 MB) and
 * {@code app/frontend/node_modules/} on disk, both get pulled into the build
 * context -- and the host's already-extracted Node lands at exactly the path
 * the plugin checks before downloading its own, so the builder image quietly
 * runs a binary built for the host platform instead of the one it would have
 * fetched itself. Same failure class {@link ProductionComposeTest} guards
 * for compose: a change that works on the machine that made it and fails
 * only somewhere else.
