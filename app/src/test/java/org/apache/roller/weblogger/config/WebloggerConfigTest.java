 *
 * <p>The initializer itself runs exactly once per JVM, at class-load, before
 * this or any other test can intervene -- by the time any test method runs,
 * {@code WebloggerConfig} is already loaded and its static block has already
 * either succeeded or (fatally, since nothing would have loaded) failed. This
