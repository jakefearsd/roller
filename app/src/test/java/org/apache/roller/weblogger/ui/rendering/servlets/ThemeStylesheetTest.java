/**
 * A theme's {@code *-custom.css} is rendered through Velocity like every
 * other theme template (it carries {@code $url.site} interpolations), which
 * means an ordinary CSS comment is not inert the way a CSS author expects:
 * Velocity has already interpolated the whole file by the time a browser
 * sees it, and it does not know or care that the surrounding text is a
 * comment.
 *
 * <p>A bare {@code #someName} inside such a comment, with no parentheses, is
 * a valid velocimacro CALL if that macro takes no arguments -- the macro's
 * whole body is spliced into the stylesheet, silently, with no error and no
 * log line (see CLAUDE.md's Templates section: Velocity here is lenient by
 * configuration). {@code #showAudienceAssets} and
 * {@code #showWeblogCategoryLinksList} are exactly this shape today, and a
 * comment naming either one used to sit in three of these files, invoking
 * them and leaking a contact/subscribe form (or a piece of the category-nav
 * markup) into the stylesheet the moment a browser requested it. Task A5's
 * report describes finding the identical mistake in a JavaScript comment;
 * this is the CSS-comment twin.
 *
 * <p>This test does not try to distinguish a zero-argument macro name from
 * one that takes arguments (which would be harmless to mention bare, since
 * Velocity cannot match a call with no parens against a macro that requires
 * them): it bans every {@code #show...}-shaped mention inside a comment, so
 * a future macro that grows a zero-argument overload cannot silently
 * reactivate a comment that was safe when it was written. Write "the showX
 * macro" instead.
