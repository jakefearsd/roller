/**
 * Pins the 2026-08-09 hardening wave's escaping sweep so it cannot regress
 * one file at a time, the way it was originally introduced one file at a
 * time. The listed EL expressions are author-controlled free text (no
 * save-time escaping or charset restriction on any of them -- verified per
 * field during the sweep), and each one appeared raw in at least one editor
 * JSP as element content, an attribute value, or a JS string, all of which
 * were exploitable stored XSS. Every occurrence in every JSP must go
 * through fn:escapeXml (or an equivalently escaping wrapper).
 *
 * <p>If this test fails on a NEW usage you are adding: wrap it. If it fails
 * because a field gained save-time escaping and you want it delisted, move
 * the escaping evidence into this comment and remove the entry -- do not
 * loosen the pattern.
