/**
 * The browser IT harness must never leave a Roller app JVM running, whatever
 * killed the build. Four abort paths used to leak one permanently: the
 * readiness timeout in {@code start-app.sh} (which exited without killing what
 * it had started), an infrastructure failure anywhere in
 * {@code pre-integration-test} (which skips {@code post-integration-test},
 * where all cleanup lived), a Ctrl-C, and a single fixed pidfile that every
 * run truncated -- so run N+1 destroyed the only record of run N's leaked pid.
 *
 * <p>The replacement is identity-based rather than pidfile-based: every process
 * the harness starts carries {@code -Droller.it.run=<run id>} and
 * {@code -Droller.it.owner=<pid>@<start time>} on its command line, so it can
 * always be found without a file, and "is this process stale?" is answered by
 * asking whether the Maven build that owns it is still alive. These tests pin
 * the three mechanisms that follow from that: a {@code start-app.sh} that kills
 * what it started on every failure path, a {@code stop-app.sh} that works with
 * no pidfile at all, a pre-run sweep that reaps other runs' corpses but leaves
 * a concurrent run alone, and a supervisor that reaps when the build it belongs
 * to dies without reaching any cleanup phase.
 *
 * <p>Linux only: the assertions drive {@code ps}/{@code kill} and the harness
 * is only ever run on Linux (CI) or a developer's Linux box.
