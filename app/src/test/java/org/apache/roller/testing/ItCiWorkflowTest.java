/**
 * Pins the CI side of the browser-IT harness: how many browsers the nightly
 * is allowed to run at once, and whether a failing nightly leaves behind
 * enough evidence to diagnose itself.
 *
 * <p>Both were learned the hard way. {@code junit-platform.properties} sets
 * class-parallelism to 4, a value chosen for -- and documented against -- a
 * 16-core developer machine, where "each worker holds a Chrome, so the
 * binding constraint is memory". A GitHub-hosted runner is not that machine,
 * and it inherited the number silently. When the runner image moved from
 * ubuntu24/20260810.271 to 20260816.277 the nightly began failing every
 * night with Chrome renderer timeouts scattered across a different handful
 * of classes each run -- several reported with a NEGATIVE remaining
 * deadline, i.e. the command's timeout had already expired before the
 * browser was scheduled at all, which is starvation rather than a slow page.
 * The parallelism must therefore be overridable per environment, and CI must
 * actually take a lower value rather than inheriting the local default.
 *
 * <p>The second test exists because of what that outage cost. The app log
 * carrying the answer -- {@code it-work/app-<run id>.log} -- lives only on
 * the runner and dies with it, so six consecutive red nightlies produced no
 * evidence anyone could read afterwards. That is also why a separate,
 * genuinely code-shaped failure on the same job (a 403 on the admin
 * {@code createUser!save.rol} POST, CLAUDE.md's "MECHANISM NOT ESTABLISHED")
 * has stayed unexplained: nothing survives the run that could explain it.
