/**
 * Lazily started PostgreSQL container shared by every test in the JVM.
 *
 * <p>Roller became PostgreSQL-only during this fork's simplification, and
 * tests run against the same database engine as production rather than
 * the embedded Derby they used before. The container's schema is built by
 * applying the real {@code bin/db/migrations} chain (see
 * {@link RollerDatabaseExtension}), so there is no second, hand-maintained
 * test schema to drift out of sync.
 *
 * <p>One container per JVM, not per class: starting Postgres costs a second or
 * two, and {@link RollerDatabaseExtension} gives each test a clean database by
 * truncating rather than by recreating the container.
 *
 * <p>Nothing stops it, by design: the container lives as long as the JVM does,
 * and Testcontainers' Ryuk sidecar removes it afterwards. The shutdown hook
 * below does not change that contract, it just stops relying on Ryuk being the
 * <em>only</em> thing that can clean up. Ryuk is a single process that can be
 * absent, and orphaned testcontainers containers with no Ryuk in existence
 * have been seen on developer machines. The hook covers every exit the JVM
 * gets to observe; Ryuk still covers the ones it does not (SIGKILL, a crash).
