/**
 * Starts the PostgreSQL container and points Roller's configuration at it
 * before any test class is loaded.
 *
 * <p>This has to happen this early because {@code WebloggerConfig} reads its
 * properties in a static initializer, once per JVM. The database coordinates
 * are only known after Testcontainers has assigned a port, so if any test class
 * touches {@code WebloggerConfig} first — even one that never uses the database
 * — the whole run is stuck with the default JNDI datasource and every
 * database-backed test fails with "cannot locate JNDI DataSource".
 *
 * <p>Registered through {@code META-INF/services/
 * org.junit.platform.launcher.LauncherSessionListener}, which the JUnit
 * Platform loads before test discovery.
