<%-- Extract the menu from the request. The model attribute "menu" may collide
     with other attributes during request dispatching, so we safely cast it.
     Shared (via translation-time include) by tiles-tabbedpage.jsp and
     tiles-mainmenupage.jsp -- both render the same nav-rail markup from the
     "navMenu" this sets, so the extraction must not drift between them. --%>

    Object menuObj = request.getAttribute("menu");
    Menu navMenu = (menuObj instanceof Menu) ? (Menu) menuObj : null;
    request.setAttribute("navMenu", navMenu);
