<%-- "${request.rollerVersion}" would be wrong here: inside JSP EL, the bare
     identifier "request" is the *implicit* HttpServletRequest object, not a
     shorthand for requestScope -- ".rollerVersion" would try (and fail) to
     call a getRollerVersion() bean-property getter on the servlet request
     itself, not read the attribute set above. That mistake ("${request.version}"
     /"${request.revision}") is exactly what rendered every footer as
     "Version  ()": both resolved to null, and spring:message dutifully
     formatted the two blanks into the pattern. Bare "${rollerVersion}" lets
     EL's normal scope search (page/request/session/application) find the
     request attribute directly. When it is somehow still empty (a version
     resource that failed to load), skip the "Version" clause instead of
     rendering empty parens. --%>
