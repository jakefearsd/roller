<%-- The rail's context header: which weblog you are working in (falls back
     to the signed-in user when there is no weblog in play, e.g. the main
     menu / global admin screens). The "Logged in as" / "Editing weblog"
     labels stay for assistive tech only -- the visible rail is just the
     name, the mono handle, and (for a weblog) a status dot. --%>
