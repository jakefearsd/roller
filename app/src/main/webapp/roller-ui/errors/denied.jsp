<%-- Reached via RedirectController's "/access-denied.rol", which now
     returns the ".denied" view name so RollerViewResolver wraps this
     fragment in the ".tiles-errorpage" layout (head/banner/footer, the same
     design-system CSS -- roller-tokens.css/roller.css -- every other admin
     page loads) instead of forwarding straight to this raw JSP. Deliberately
     does NOT use <fmt:message>/<spring:message>: those resolve locale from
     the request's Accept-Language (falling back to the server's default
     locale), which is how this used to render in German for a non-English
     client -- see 404.jsp's equivalent comment for the same fix applied to
     the container-level error pages. Hardcoded English. --%>
<div class="card card-body">
    <h2 class="roller-page-title">Access denied</h2>
    <p>You don't have permission to do that. The usual reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The entry belongs to a weblog you can't edit -- or you already
            submitted it for review, which hands it to a weblog admin.</li>
        <li>You submitted a stale page left over from an earlier sign-in
            under a different account. Reload and try again.</li>
        <li>You signed in with the wrong capitalization of your username.
            Sign out and back in with the correct one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If none of those fit, ask your site administrator.</p>
