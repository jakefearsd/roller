/*
 * Local draft recovery for the entry and page editors.
 *
 * Deliberately local: see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-w3-autosave-design.md.
 * The short version is that a server-side autosave would multiply
 * weblogentry_revision rows by the autosave rate against a retention default of
 * -1 (keep everything), and would have to invent a real entry row for anything
 * anyone started typing. The work that actually gets lost -- tab crash, wrong
 * tab closed, session expired while the laptop slept -- is all lost in the same
 * browser it was typed in, which is exactly what localStorage covers.
 *
 * Used in: EntryEdit.jsp, PageEdit.jsp. Loaded as a plain static script rather
 * than a JSP include (unlike ajax-user.js) because nothing here needs JSP
 * interpolation -- every translated string arrives through data- attributes on
 * the bar element.

     * is annoying to redo.
     *
     * Only the three universal ones live here. Anything Roller-page-specific
     * comes in through options.exclude, because the right answer differs
     * between the two editors and the module has no business guessing:
     *
     *   - the editor's own textarea (bean.text on entries, bean.content on
     *     pages) -- its authoritative value arrives through the getText/setText
     *     seam and is already captured as snapshot.text. Capturing it again
     *     doubles every snapshot and hands differs() a possibly-stale second
     *     copy of the same content to compare independently of the first.
     *   - bean.status ON ENTRIES ONLY. Restoring it there is inert
     *     (EntryEditController overwrites it from the submit button's
     *     formaction), but COMPARING it is not: doEntryEditSave mutates the
     *     bean and forwards, so the page rendered right after a successful
     *     Post carries PUBLISHED while the snapshot taken at submit holds
     *     DRAFT. differs() would see a difference, raise a phantom "unsaved
     *     changes" bar over a save that had just succeeded, and keep raising it
     *     on every later visit -- eventually offering days-old text over
     *     something newer. On PAGES bean.status must stay in: it is a visible
     *     <select> the author sets, and PageBean.copyTo writes it straight
     *     through.
