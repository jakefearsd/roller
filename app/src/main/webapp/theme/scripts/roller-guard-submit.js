/*
 * Double-submit guard for the slow, expensive or irreversible admin actions:
 * a bulk upload, a theme import, a crop, a newsletter send. A second click
 * before the first response arrives runs the whole operation twice, and for
 * the newsletter that means the list is mailed twice with no undo.
 *
 * Opt in per form: `class="guard-submit"` on the <form>, and optionally
 * `data-busy-label` on the button that should change text while it works.
 *
 * THE FORMACTION CAVEAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A
 * ONE-LINER. A submit button's name/value pair is only sent if the button is
 * enabled AT THE MOMENT THE BROWSER SERIALISES THE FORM. Disabling it inside
 * the submit handler therefore drops the name/value -- and both Entries.jsp
 * and Maintenance.jsp route entirely on which submit button was clicked
 * (`name="duplicateId"`, `formaction=...`), so the naive version silently
 * sends the wrong request. Deferring the disable to a setTimeout(0) lets the
 * default action commit first, then blocks the second click.
 *
 * It is deliberately a visual/interaction guard only: nothing here is a
 * substitute for the server refusing a duplicate. A user with script off, or
 * a doubled request from a flaky network, still reaches the controller.
