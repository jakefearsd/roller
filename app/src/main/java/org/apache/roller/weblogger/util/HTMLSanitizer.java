/**
 * The boundary between what an author writes and what a visitor's browser
 * executes.
 *
 * <p>Entries are stored as Markdown and rendered to HTML, and raw HTML passes
 * through that rendering untouched -- both because authors paste embed
 * snippets and because the shortcodes ({@code [image]}, {@code [gallery]},
 * {@code [map]}, {@code [cta]}, {@code [faq]}) expand into HTML before Markdown
 * runs. Nothing upstream of here is a security control; this is.
 *
 * <p>Built on the OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, which <em>parses</em> the document
 * and re-serializes only what the policy below permits. The implementation this
 * replaced pattern-matched HTML with regular expressions -- the class of
 * sanitizer that loses to markup a browser will "repair" into something
 * executable. Wave 3 hit exactly that: literal {@code &quot;} text survived two
 * escaping passes, and the browser's own attribute decoding then manufactured
 * real quotes inside a JSON payload.
 *
 * <p>The policy is deliberately permissive about <em>structure</em> and strict
 * about <em>behaviour</em>: everything the shortcodes emit survives intact,
 * relative links work (Markdown authors link to their own posts constantly, and
 * the previous sanitizer stripped those), and anything that can execute --
 * {@code <script>}, {@code <iframe>}, {@code <form>}, {@code on*} handlers,
 * {@code javascript:} and {@code data:} URLs -- is removed.
 *
 * <p><b>One thing this policy cannot express:</b> CSS custom properties.
 * {@code CssSchema.withProperties("--ar")} throws outright, so an inline
 * {@code style="--ar:1.34"} is dropped. The gallery grid therefore carries its
 * aspect ratio as an {@code ar-NNN} class resolved by rules in the theme's own
 * (unsanitized) style block -- see {@code GalleryMarkup} and the
 * {@code #showGalleryGridStyles} macro.
