 * The one cache a rendering servlet talks to for a given request.
 *
 * <p>A weblog is either the site-wide front page or it is not, and that answer
 * decides which cache holds its rendered output, how a cached copy expires, and
 * what its key looks like. The servlets used to re-ask that question at every
 * cache operation -- {@code if (isSiteWide) siteWideCache.x() else
 * weblogPageCache.x()}, four or five times down one method -- which put the
 * same decision in several places and made it possible for them to disagree.
 * Asking once, at the top of the request, and holding the answer as a
 * {@code RenderCache} is the whole point of this interface.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately an <em>adapter</em> over the three cache classes rather
 * than an interface they implement. Their expiry contracts genuinely differ --
 * see the note in {@link SiteWideCache} -- and collapsing them into a shared
 * base would be a behavioural change wearing cleanup's clothes. Nothing here
 * changes how any cache behaves; this only gives the servlets one name for
 * "the cache for this request".
 *
 * @param <R> the parsed request this cache builds keys from, which is what
 *            differs between the page and feed servlets
