 * is throwing exceptions if it decides to block a request. For example double slashes (//) in the request are
 * interpreted as non-normalized URL and rejected by throwing RequestRejectedExceptions.
 * Those exceptions are caught by the server and cause 500 errors which isn't very nice behavior.</p>
 *
