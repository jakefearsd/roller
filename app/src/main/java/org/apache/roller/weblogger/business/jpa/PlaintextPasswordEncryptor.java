/**
 * EclipseLink login encryptor ({@code eclipselink.login.encryptor}) that
 * leaves the database password exactly as configured.
 *
 * <p>EclipseLink passes {@code jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password} through
 * {@link #decryptPassword} before logging in. Its default encryptor treats
 * any value that parses as hex as one of its own encrypted passwords, so an
 * even-length all-hex plaintext (what {@code openssl rand -hex 24} prints)
 * fails decryption and the persistence unit never deploys
 * (EclipseLink-7360, "Database password was encrypted by deprecated
 * algorithm"). Roller's password always arrives as plaintext from
 * configuration or the environment, and EclipseLink's in-memory encryption
 * uses a key hard-coded in EclipseLink, so it protects nothing worth the
 * misreading.
 *
 * <p>EclipseLink instantiates this reflectively, so it needs the public
 * no-argument constructor.
