/**
 * The half of a per-weblog render cache that {@link WeblogPageCache} and
 * {@link WeblogFeedCache} have always had in common: reading their own
 * configuration, holding a {@link Cache}, and expiring an entry lazily against
 * the weblog's {@code lastModified}.
 *
 * <p>These two caches are identical in contract -- neither registers a
 * {@link org.apache.roller.weblogger.util.cache.CacheHandler}, so
 * {@code CacheManager} never reaches either, and a cached rendering is only
 * ever withheld once the weblog has changed under it. What differs is what
 * they cache and how they build a key, which is why {@code generateKey} stays
 * on the subclasses and is not modelled here.
 *
 * <p>{@link SiteWideCache} is deliberately <em>not</em> part of this
 * hierarchy. It is the one render cache registered as a CacheHandler, it is
 * invalidated eagerly and wholesale, and its {@code get} takes no timestamp
 * because it has no per-weblog expiry to apply. Giving it this base would mean
 * giving it an expiry contract it does not have. Callers that want to treat
 * all three uniformly have {@link RenderCache}, which adapts them without
 * merging them.
 *
 * <p>The subclass supplies its own {@link Logger} rather than inheriting one,
 * so that every line these methods emit is still attributed to the concrete
 * cache. An operator reading {@code HIT}/{@code MISS} lines needs to know
 * which cache produced them, and a base-class logger would have quietly
 * relabelled every one of them.
