 * serving as the site-wide front page.
 *
 * <p>One class covers both page and feed requests because {@code SiteWideCache}
 * itself has a {@code generateKey} overload for each; which one to call is
 * supplied as {@code keyFunction} rather than branched on here.
 *
 * <p>The {@code lastModified} argument to {@link #get} is discarded, and that
 * is the correct reading of the code this replaces: the servlets never had a
 * timestamp to give this side -- {@link SiteWideCache#get(String)} takes none.
 * Site-wide content is dropped wholesale through {@code CacheManager}, never
 * expired against one weblog.
