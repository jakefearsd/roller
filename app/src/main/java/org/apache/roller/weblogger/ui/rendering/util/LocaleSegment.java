/**
 * Whether a url path segment names a locale.
 *
 * <p>This is the first decision made about any weblog url, and it decides what
 * every segment after it means: read {@code /myblog/de/entry/x} with "de" as a
 * locale and "entry" is the context; read it as a context and the whole url is
 * something else entirely. A url is not rejected when this is wrong -- it is
 * silently understood as a different request.
 *
 * <p>It therefore has to be one rule. It was two: {@code WeblogRequest} and
 * {@code WeblogRequestMapper} each carried their own copy, byte for byte
 * identical, one deciding how to route a url and the other how to parse it.
 * They agreed only because nobody had edited either. CPD does not catch it --
 * the block is around a hundred tokens and the gate runs at two hundred.
