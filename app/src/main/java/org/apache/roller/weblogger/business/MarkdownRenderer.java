/**
 * Turns an entry's markdown into HTML, for entries that opted in by setting
 * {@code content_type} to {@link #MARKDOWN_CONTENT_TYPE}.
 *
 * <p>Three deliberate choices, each of which a future change could quietly
 * undo:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Raw HTML passes through</b> ({@code escapeHtml=false}, commonmark's
 *     default). Authors paste embed snippets and hand-written markup into
 *     posts, and shortcodes expand into HTML immediately after this step, so
 *     escaping here would leave both visible as source text. This is NOT a
 *     security decision: {@code HTMLSanitizer} still runs last on the combined
 *     output, and it -- not commonmark -- is the XSS boundary.</li>
 * <li><b>It runs before shortcode expansion.</b> The shortcodes emit
 *     {@code <figure>}/{@code <div>} blocks; feeding those through a markdown
 *     parser afterwards would reflow and mangle them. See
 *     {@code WeblogEntry.render}.</li>
 * <li><b>Extensions are fixed, not configurable.</b> Tables, strikethrough and
 *     autolink are what a travel or photography post actually uses; making the
 *     set per-weblog would mean the same source rendering differently in two
 *     places, which is exactly the drift the shortcode parsers were designed
 *     to avoid.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The parser and renderer are immutable and thread-safe once built
 * (commonmark documents this), so both are shared statics.
