/**
 * The rules that turn an author's raw entry input into stored values.
 *
 * <p>Shared by {@code EntryBean} (the JSP editor) and the automation API so
 * the two cannot drift. Two rules matter more than the rest:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An entry title is stored HTML-escaped. This is the only place raw
 *       author input becomes escaped markup for an entry, which is why
 *       {@code WeblogEntry.getTitle()} returns entity-escaped text and every
 *       theme emits {@code $entry.title} bare. A PAGE title is the opposite --
 *       stored raw, escaped at render -- so copying this rule to the page side
 *       double-encodes and copying the page rule here is stored XSS.</li>
 *   <li>A pubtime is wall-clock time in the WEBLOG's zone. Blank means
 *       "publish now"; an unparseable non-blank value throws, so a mistyped
 *       time blocks the save instead of silently publishing immediately.</li>
 * </ul>
