/**
 * The one way this application builds an XML parser.
 *
 * <p>A bare {@code new SAXBuilder()} resolves DOCTYPEs and external entities,
 * which is XXE: a document can name {@code file:///etc/passwd} (or an http
 * URL, making the server an SSRF proxy) and have the contents pulled into the
 * parse. Every SAXBuilder in Roller goes through here so that the safe
 * configuration is a property of the codebase rather than of whoever wrote
 * the most recent call site.
 *
 * <p><strong>None of Roller's three callers parses attacker-controlled XML
 * today</strong> -- the runtime config defs and admin menus are classpath
 * resources, and {@code theme.xml} ships in the themes directory -- so this
 * closes no live hole. It exists because "safe only because of where the
 * input happens to come from" is a property that quietly stops holding: a
 * user-uploadable theme bundle would make all three reachable, and the
 * failure would be silent. Cheaper to hold the invariant than to remember to
 * re-audit it.
 *
 * <p>DOCTYPEs are disabled outright rather than merely restricting entity
 * resolution, which is the stronger and simpler control. That is affordable
 * only because no shipped file declares one; {@code SafeXmlTest} records the
 * check, and a future file that needs a DOCTYPE is a deliberate decision
 * rather than a reason to loosen this.
