/**
 * A Spring specific implementation of a WebloggerProvider, and the bean
 * that answers "is the business tier up?" for everything that needs to know
 * (the bootstrap sites, the filters ahead of the security chain, the
 * interceptor). There is no static equivalent: a class that needs the tier
 * injects {@link Weblogger} or this provider.
 *
 * <p>Bootstrapping builds (or, for the {@link ApplicationContext} constructor,
 * reuses) a Spring context and hands back its {@link Weblogger} bean. It owns
 * the whole startup sequence the two bootstrap sites ({@code RollerLifecycle}
 * and {@code InstallController}) used to spell out by hand: the
 * prepare-before-construct guard, obtaining the bean, {@code initialize()},
 * and {@code release()} of the bootstrapping thread's persistence session.
 *
 * <p>Production gets the {@code @Component} (constructed with the Boot
 * context, into which {@link WebloggerBeanConfig} is already component-
 * scanned). {@code TestUtils} uses {@link #standalone()}, which builds a
 * private context from {@link WebloggerBeanConfig} on first bootstrap.
