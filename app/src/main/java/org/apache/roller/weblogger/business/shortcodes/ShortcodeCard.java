/**
 * What the entry editor offers an author for one shortcode: a label and the
 * text to drop at the cursor.
 *
 * <p>The card belongs to the {@link ShortcodeHandler} rather than to the
 * editor page, so the editor's insert menu is generated from the same registry
 * that renders entries. A sixth shortcode therefore cannot ship with a working
 * renderer and no way for an author to discover it -- the compiler asks for
 * the card when the handler is written.
 *
 * @param labelKey         message-bundle key for the menu label. Written as a
 *                         literal at each call site, never assembled from
 *                         {@link #name}: {@code MessageKeyTest} scans source
 *                         text for key references, and a computed key reads to
 *                         it as an unused bundle entry.
 * @param snippet          the exact text inserted at the cursor, in the
 *                         shortcode syntax {@code ShortcodeExpander} parses.
 *                         Empty when {@link #usesMediaChooser} is true. Must
 *                         stay free of {@code <} and {@code &}: it travels to
 *                         the browser inside an HTML attribute, and the plain
 *                         form is what keeps that unambiguous.
 * @param usesMediaChooser whether picking this card opens the media chooser
 *                         instead of inserting {@link #snippet} -- true for
 *                         shortcodes keyed to a specific uploaded file, which
 *                         an author cannot be expected to name by hand.
