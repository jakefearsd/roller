/**
 * What a {@link ShortcodeHandler} needs to know about the thing being
 * rendered. Deliberately three methods: a survey of the five built-in
 * handlers found they use their subject for exactly this much -- the weblog
 * (media lookups, UTM source), a slug (UTM campaign), and the unexpanded
 * source text ({@link MapPins} and {@link FaqBlocks} re-parse it to build the
 * JSON-LD twin of what the shortcode renders).
 *
 * <p>Both {@link org.apache.roller.weblogger.pojos.WeblogEntry} and
 * {@link org.apache.roller.weblogger.pojos.WeblogPage} implement this, which
 * is what lets every shortcode work on a page without the handlers knowing
 * pages exist.
 *
 * <p>Implementations may return null from any method; handlers already treat
 * a missing subject as "render what you can" rather than failing.
