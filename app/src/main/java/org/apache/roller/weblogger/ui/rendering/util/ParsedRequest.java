/**
 * An abstract class representing any request made to Roller that has been
 * parsed in order to extract relevant pieces of information from the url.
 *
 * NOTE: It is extremely important to mention that this class and all of its
 * subclasses are meant to be extremely light weight.  Meaning they should
 * avoid any time consuming operations at all costs, especially operations
 * which require a trip to the db.  Those operations should be used very, very
 * sparingly and should only be triggered when it's guaranteed that they are
 * needed.
 *
 * <p>Those sparing lookups go through the {@link Weblogger} the request object
 * was constructed with, never through a static locator. The no-arg
 * constructors build a <em>carrier</em> with no facade at all: every heavy
 * value on such an object has to arrive through its setters, and a lazy
 * lookup on one throws {@link IllegalStateException} rather than reaching for
 * a locator. Production code constructs every request object with the
 * facade; the carriers exist for hand-built fixtures.
