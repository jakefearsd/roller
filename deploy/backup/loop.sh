# No cron daemon in the app image this service now runs (it used to be the
# postgres:16 base image, back when the scripts were bind-mounted in), so
# this is the whole scheduler: wake up once an hour, and if it's BACKUP_HOUR
# (UTC) and backup.sh hasn't already run today, run it. Equivalent to a
# `0 <BACKUP_HOUR> * * *` crontab entry, without needing cron installed.
