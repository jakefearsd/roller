-- The Umami half of the analytics contract (see
-- bin/db/migrations/V017__analytics_contract.sql for the rollerdb half).
-- This file lives in the umami DATABASE, not the rollerdb migration chain
-- -- PostgreSQL has no cross-database queries, so V017 could not create a
-- view over website_event even though it owns everything else in the
-- contract. Applied by deploy/deploy.sh after migrate.sh (grafana_ro must
-- already exist) and after the ensure-service-databases step (the umami
-- database must already exist). CREATE OR REPLACE + GRANT are idempotent,
-- so re-running this on every deploy is a no-op, same contract migrate.sh
-- gives the rollerdb chain. Versioned here (not hand-applied) so replacing
-- Umami later means rewriting this one file, not any dashboard.
--
-- Column shapes follow Umami v2's postgresql schema (website_event, with
-- event_type = 1 meaning pageview and session_id identifying a visitor). If
-- an Umami upgrade changes them, this view is the only thing to fix.
-- UmamiViewScriptTest (app/src/test/.../business/startup) mirrors this
-- shape in a scratch table and applies this exact file, so the repo's only
-- knowledge of Umami's schema lives here plus that test's minimal copy.
--
-- Grafana joins this view's website_id against rollerdb's
-- analytics_weblog_sites view (V017) to resolve a weblog handle -- a
-- cross-database join Grafana performs itself, since Postgres cannot.
--
-- GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE is deliberately NOT in this file. A migration
-- (or a plain script like this one) cannot portably state its own
-- database's name -- current_database() would need dynamic SQL to use
-- inside a GRANT -- so deploy.sh issues
-- `GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE ... TO grafana_ro` for BOTH rollerdb and
-- umami right before/after this file is applied, where the real database
-- names are already known as env vars (see deploy.sh's analytics step and
-- V017's header for the same decision, restated on that side of the
-- split). This file's grants stay schema/table-level, which is all it can
-- state without knowing its own database's name.
