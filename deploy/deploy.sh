# Deploy or upgrade the production stack.

# There is almost nothing left here, and that is the point. Ordering used to
# live in this script -- bring postgres up, wait, copy migrate.sh into its
# container, run it, then start the app -- and now lives in
# docker-compose.prod.yml as depends_on conditions, where `docker compose up
# -d` enforces it whether or not anyone runs this file. What remains is a
# convenience wrapper: pull, up, and wait for health with a real timeout,
# then check for an admin account and say how to create one if none exists.
#
# The old version also had a genuine bug this shape cannot have: it expanded
# ${UMAMI_DB:-umami} in the host shell, which never sourced .env, so renaming a
# service database in .env made it provision the default names while the
# containers used the renamed ones. Those names are now read inside the
# provision container, which compose populates from .env correctly.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy.sh [--prune]
#
#   --prune   run `docker image prune -f` after a successful deploy
#
# Run from the directory holding docker-compose.prod.yml and .env.
