# Production image for Roller, built from THIS tree (never from an upstream
# release tag or a fresh git clone). Two stages:
#
#   1. builder -- Maven reactor build of the app module only, producing the
#      executable WAR (spring-boot-maven-plugin repackages it; see
#      app/pom.xml). Layer caching is intentionally NOT optimized here: this
#      reactor (root pom + app, with bin/db/migrations pulled in as a
#      resource at generate-resources time) doesn't play well with
#      `mvn dependency:go-offline` as a separate cached layer, so every build
#      re-resolves dependencies. Acceptable for now; revisit if build time
#      becomes a problem.
#   2. runtime -- just a JRE, the WAR, baked-in themes, and the migrations
#      SQL for reference/exec-based use by deploy tooling (Stage 1C Task 3).
#
# Run: java -jar roller.war (Boot's embedded Tomcat serves the app at /roller
# on 8080, and a second embedded connector serves /actuator/health on the
# management port 8090 -- see app/src/main/resources/application.properties).
# Runtime config is supplied entirely by ROLLER_* environment variables, which
# WebloggerConfig overlays on top of its built-in defaults; at minimum set
# ROLLER_DATABASE_CONFIGURATIONTYPE, ROLLER_DATABASE_JDBC_*, and the
# ROLLER_MAIL_* keys. See deploy/.env.example for the full set.

# curl is not in the base JRE image; installed for container healthchecks
# against the management port (docker exec ... curl 8090/actuator/health --
# used here and by docker-compose.prod.yml's app healthcheck in Task 2).
#
# webp (Debian/Ubuntu's name for libwebp-tools) provides the cwebp binary
# that CwebpEncoder shells out to for WebP renditions of uploaded images.
# Roller feature-detects it at first use and falls back to a JPEG/PNG-only
# rendition ladder when absent, so this is an enhancement, not a hard
# dependency -- but production should always have it.
#
# postgresql-client provides psql/createdb for /app/provision.sh and pg_dump
# for the nightly backup loop -- this one image is the app, the provisioner and
# the backup runner, because those are exactly the roles needing the WAR or a
# PostgreSQL client. The version assertion is load-bearing: pg_dump refuses a
# server newer than itself, so a base-image change that dropped the client
# below 16 would break backups silently at 03:00 rather than at build time.

# makes a failed apt-get report the pg_dump version message instead of its own,
# which sends you looking in the wrong place.
