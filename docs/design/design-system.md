# Roller Design System — "Quiet Instrument"

This is the design spec used to build the admin UI's preview cards and, from
there, the shipped tokens/components.

**This repository is the source of record.** All seventeen preview cards are
committed under this directory (see [The cards](#the-cards-17) below) — spec
text and rendered cards travel together, so a checkout is enough to see the
whole system and nothing can drift somewhere the repo cannot see. The
companion claude.ai/design project "Roller Design System"
(`a80e9dad-2900-4ed8-a00f-c0331e247434`) renders the same files and is where
it is convenient to *iterate* a card visually; when it and this directory
disagree, this directory wins, and a card iterated there is not done until it
lands here.

Card files are self-contained HTML — inline `<style>`, no external requests —
so opening one in a browser needs no build step and no server.

# Roller Design System — "Quiet Instrument" — build spec for preview cards

Client decisions (locked): quiet tool personality; teal accent from the travel theme; light AND dark; one project.

## Tokens (exact values — every card derives from these, no other colors)

Light: --paper:#F7F9F9 --surface:#FFFFFF --ink:#17262A --ink-soft:#5A6E72 --line:#DCE4E4
       --accent:#0F6E68 --accent-quiet:#E3F0EE --good:#2F7D4F --warn:#9A6A1F --bad:#A33B2E --focus:#2AA198
Dark:  --paper:#131C1C --surface:#1A2626 --ink:#DCE7E5 --ink-soft:#8FA5A2 --line:#2A3838
       --accent:#4FB3AA --accent-quiet:#1E3230 --good:#6FBF8F --warn:#D0A45C --bad:#D0705F --focus:#2AA198

Radius: 6px (cards/inputs), 99px (pills). Shadows: none in light except overlay contexts; rely on --line borders. Spacing scale: 4/8/12/16/24/32.

**Documented divergences — deliberate, do not "fix" them.** A public theme may
hold its own identity on *neutrals* provided it keeps the family accent; the
test of whether a difference is identity or drift is whether someone can say
why. Two are on the record:

- `travel` keeps `--tg-paper: #fcfbf7` (warm cream, against the cool `#F7F9F9`)
  and `--tg-radius: 10px` (against 6px). Both belong to its guide-book
  character. Its accent and remaining neutrals were repointed to exact tokens
  in the 2026-08-10 pass — `--tg-accent` had drifted to `#0f6f63`, one hex
  digit off the very token it originated, which is what drift looks like next
  to identity.
- `portfolio` keeps its own near-black neutrals and takes the spec's *dark*
  `--accent` (`#4FB3AA`) verbatim. Dark is its identity; the accent is the
  family tie.

## Type

- UI + headings: "IBM Plex Sans", system-ui fallback. Weights: 450 body, 600 headings/labels.
- Data (slugs, dates, counts, ids): "IBM Plex Mono", ui-monospace fallback, font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums.
- Scale: 12px caps-labels (letter-spacing .08em, uppercase, --ink-soft), 14.5px/1.55 body, 16px section heads, 20px page titles (600), 26px the one oversized element, 28px reserved.
- **These six values are the whole scale. There is no support tier below 12px.**
  The editor rail originally shipped its own 11 / 11.5 / 12.5 / 13px micro-scale
  — and so did its approved card, which is how it survived review — and both were
  collapsed onto this scale in the 2026-08-10 consistency pass. The rule that
  settles any future case: a **label or help text is 12px**, a **value, control or
  body text is 14.5px**, and *quiet is expressed by color and weight, never by
  going smaller* (that is signature move 4 read in the other direction). Shrinking
  below 12px to make something recede is the mistake this line exists to block.
- Card/section headers (`.card-header`, `.section-head` — accordion panel titles, settings-form "display group" headers) use the caps-label role, not an h3/h4's own default size — a heading label, not a second page title.
- Preview cards may load Plex from Google Fonts <link> ONLY IF the design pane allows external fetches — safer: use font-family:"IBM Plex Sans", system-ui and accept fallback rendering in cards; note in the tokens card that the implementation self-hosts Plex as a webjar.

## Signature moves

1. THE SPINE: active nav item in the rail = 2px inset-left rule in --accent + --accent-quiet background + 600 weight. Nothing else in the rail is colored.
2. THE RAIL (replaces the "Powered by Apache Roller" card): 232px sidebar; top block = weblog context (weblog name 600, handle in mono, small status dot --good "Live"); below: tool groups under caps-labels (CONTENT: Entries, Pages, Media, Comments, Inquiries / DESIGN: Theme, Stylesheet, Templates / SETTINGS: Weblog, Members, Maintenance). Footer of rail: user + Sign out, quiet.
3. EMPTY STATES AS INVITATIONS: icon-free; one 16px 600 line ("No entries yet."), one --ink-soft sentence ("Your first post starts the archive."), one primary button ("Write an entry"). Never a bare table strip.
4. WEIGHT, NOT SIZE: a page gets at most one piece of *layout* hierarchy allowed to sit outside the type scale (an entry title, a card's lead field) — everything else that needs emphasis reaches for font-weight (600, against 450 body) rather than a bigger size. The editor's title field is the canonical example: 26px serif, the one oversized element on the page, capped there on purpose; every other "this matters" cue on the same page — status pill, rail group labels, drawer headers — stays on-scale and leans on weight/color instead. Adding a second oversized element to compete with the title is the mistake this rule exists to block.

## Card format (every file)

- First line EXACTLY: <!-- @dsCard group="GROUP" name="NAME" subtitle="SUBTITLE" -->
- Self-contained HTML: inline <style>, no external requests (fonts get family names + fallbacks only).
- Body = two panels side by side (flex, gap 24, wrap): .panel--light and .panel--dark, each a rounded container painting its OWN --paper and carrying its full token set via scoped CSS custom properties (define both sets as classes; do NOT rely on prefers-color-scheme — the card must show both at once regardless of viewer theme).
- Each panel labeled "Light" / "Dark" in caps-label style.
- Realistic Roller content ONLY (weblog "Coastal Guides", handle coastal-guides; entries like "Field Notes from the Coast", "Harbor Cottage Guide"; pages About/Contact; inquiry from "Maren Vole <maren@example.com>"). No lorem.

## The cards (19)

All committed in this directory. The twelve below are the foundational set
(built before the JSPs, as the spec for them); the five listed under *Shipped
reference cards* further down were built alongside their templates. Paths are
grouped to match each card's `@dsCard group=`.

1. `foundations/`tokens-colors.html      group="Foundations" — both palettes as labeled swatch grids (name, hex, usage note per token).
2. `foundations/`tokens-type.html        group="Foundations" — type specimen: caps-label, body para, section head, page title, mono data row; the self-hosting note.
3. `foundations/`tokens-spacing.html     group="Foundations" — spacing/radius demo: a card anatomy diagram with measurements.
4. `shell/`shell-admin.html        group="Shell" — FULL admin frame at ~1100px wide per panel (allowed to stack panels vertically for room): top bar (product name left tiny; weblog switcher center-left; user right), the RAIL with spine on "Entries", content area with page header ("Entries" title + "Write an entry" primary button right) over a table placeholder. This is the hero card.
5. `components/`components-buttons.html group="Components" — primary (accent bg), secondary (line border, ink text), destructive (bad, outline until hover), disabled, small size; focus ring state shown on one.
6. `components/`components-pills.html   group="Components" — status pills: Published(good tint)/Draft(warn tint)/Pending(accent-quiet)/Scheduled(line tint + mono date); plus counts style.
7. `components/`components-nav-rail.html group="Components" — the rail alone, all three groups, spine on Pages, hover state on one item.
8. `forms/`forms-sections.html     group="Forms" — a Weblog Settings excerpt: two grouped sections ("General", "Newsletter") each with 2-3 fields; labels ABOVE inputs (kill the label-column gutter), help text under, one field showing an inline validation error (bad text + border, message "That is not a list UUID. Copy it exactly from Listmonk.").
9. `tables/`tables-list.html        group="Tables" — entries table: checkbox col, title (link, 600) + mono slug under, status pill, category, mono date, row hover; header row caps-labels; selection bar variant shown above (2 selected · Delete).
10. `tables/`tables-empty-states.html group="Tables" — three empty states per the signature: Entries, Inquiries ("No inquiries yet." / "Messages from your contact form land here." / no button), Media ("Add a photo" button).
11. `public/`public-travel-page.html  group="Public themes" — travel-theme _page treatment: teal guide-card header (site title, nav All/General/About), page title, prose, and the CONTACT FORM styled to travel's identity (teal accents, card fields). Single light panel only (travel is a light theme) — note says so.
12. `public/`public-portfolio.html    group="Public themes" — two stacked sections, dark only (portfolio is dark by identity): (a) _page treatment: header + prose + contact form on near-black; (b) the no-image entry card: grid card with generated placeholder (title set large in Plex over a subtle teal-to-transparent linear-gradient wash + mono date) next to the current empty-box for contrast, labeled "before / after".

## Shipped reference cards: journal + front door (Theme Wave)

The `journal` theme and the `frontpage` restyle carry reference cards under
`docs/design/journal/`. They differ from the twelve above only in *when* they
were drawn — alongside their theme templates rather than before them, since
a theme's identity is not derivable from the admin token set alone:

- `journal-home.html` — group="Quiet Journal" — the reading-first entry
  list: date marginalia, serif `qj-title`s, teal hover spine.
- `journal-permalink.html` — group="Quiet Journal" — the reading view: serif
  prose at reading measure, quiet comments.
- `journal-page.html` — group="Quiet Journal" — the `_page` treatment: About
  prose plus the contact form in journal dress.
- `frontpage-front-door.html` — group="Frontpage" — the aggregator: recent
  posts across weblogs plus the teal-wash weblog directory.

Same `@dsCard` header convention and token/type rules as the cards above;
treat these as the worked examples for any future theme's reference card.

## Shipped reference card: the editor (Editor Rebuild)

`docs/design/editor/editor-writing-surface.html` is the approved card the
admin-side `EntryEdit.jsp` rebuild was built against — drawn alongside the
JSP like the journal/frontpage cards above rather than ahead of it, because
the editor is admin chrome, not a public theme, and its rail is a shape
("writing surface
+ 252px publish rail": Publish/Organize boxes, an SEO drawer, quiet
newsletter/revisions boxes, a text-link delete) other admin edit screens with
a lot of secondary metadata may want to reuse. Same `@dsCard` header
convention as the twelve preview cards; treat it as the worked example for
"one writing surface, many settings" admin layouts, and see signature move 4
(WEIGHT, NOT SIZE) above for the rule its title field demonstrates.

## Cards drawn ahead of a rebuild (Consistency Pass, 2026-08-10)

Two screens were too far off-spec to fix by restyling, and the repo's rule is
that a card comes first. These are those cards; the JSPs are rebuilt against
them, not the other way round.

One of the two shipped. The other was overtaken by events and is recorded here
so nobody redraws it.

- `forms/`settings-with-rail.html — group="Forms" — **still pending.**
  `WeblogConfig.jsp` today carries `.form-stacked` from the Task 7 sweep, so
  its labels sit above its fields, but it has no rail: one Save at the bottom
  and no section index. The card applies the editor's two-column shape to a
  settings form — fields on the left, and a 252px rail holding a section index
  (the spine marks where you are, exactly as the nav rail does) plus a Save
  that is always reachable. The delete action is a quiet text link, matching
  the editor.
- **A comment-moderation table card once sat here, and was withdrawn.** It was
  drawn against `Comments.jsp`, and the entire comment subsystem was removed in
  W1 — servlet, manager, moderation screens, pojos, schema and all. It is not
  coming back (see CLAUDE.md's Comments section for why: the feature was
  unreachable by design, not unused by accident). The card file was deleted
  along with it; the reader-facing channels are the contact form and the
  newsletter now. Deliberately not naming the old filename here —
  `DesignCardsTest` fails the build when this spec names a card that is not on
  disk, and that check is worth more than the breadcrumb.

## Quality bar

Focus states visible; text-wrap balance on headings; tabular-nums wherever digits column; no horizontal scroll inside a panel; every color from the token set; both panels legible standalone.
