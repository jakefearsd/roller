# Configuration

Developer notes moved out of `CLAUDE.md` (which is sent with every
request) so they are read only when this area is being changed. Section
names are unchanged, so an older "see CLAUDE.md, <section>" pointer
resolves through the index at the end of `CLAUDE.md`.

## Configuration Files

### Key Configuration Locations
- **Boot Config**: `app/src/main/resources/application.properties` (server
  port/context-path, filter ordering, actuator exposure)
- **Dev Properties**: `app/src/test/resources/roller-boot-dev.properties`
  (loaded via `-Droller.custom.config` by `./roller dev` and NetBeans
  run/debug actions)
- **Servlets/Filters**: `app/src/main/java/.../boot/ServletRegistrationConfig.java`
  (Java-config transcription of the retired `web.xml`)
- **Security Config**: `app/src/main/java/.../boot/SecurityConfig.java`
  (Java-config transcription of the retired `WEB-INF/security.xml`)
- **JPA Mappings**: `app/src/main/resources/org/apache/roller/weblogger/pojos/*.orm.xml`
- **Velocity Templates**: `app/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/velocity/templates/`

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: PostgreSQL via `docker-compose.yml` (postgres only; the
  app runs via `./roller dev` / `spring-boot:run`, not in a container),
  theme reload enabled, caching disabled.
- **Production**: containerized end-to-end and **image-only** — the deploy
  host holds `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `.env`, nothing else. Two images
  per release tag: `ghcr.io/jakefearsd/roller` (WAR, themes, migrations,
  `provision.sh`, `analytics-views.sh`, `umami-views.sql`, `migrate.sh`, backup
  scripts, a PostgreSQL client) and `ghcr.io/jakefearsd/roller-caddy`
  (Caddy, Caddyfile baked in). A one-shot `provision` service creates the
  umami and listmonk databases, applies the migration chain, and grants
  `grafana_ro`; `app`, `umami` and `listmonk` declare
  `depends_on: { provision: { condition: service_completed_successfully } }`,
  so ordering is compose's job, not a bash script's.
  `analytics_traffic` is installed by a separate one-shot, `analytics-views`
  (`analytics-views.sh`), after `umami` starts — see Analytics for why it
  cannot live in `provision`. `deploy/deploy.sh` is just pull/up/wait.
  **Nothing may be bind-mounted from a checkout** — `ProductionComposeTest`
  fails the build if a bind mount, a `build:` stanza, or a non-loopback
  published port other than 80/443 reappears. Runbook:
  `docker_deployment.md`.

## Configuration scope
- **Runtime** (`runtimeConfigDefs.xml` → `roller_properties` → Admin
  Settings): `WebloggerRuntimeConfig`, DB row first, else `WebloggerConfig`.
  Hot.
- **Startup** (`roller.properties` / `roller-custom.properties`): read once
  via `WebloggerConfig`; needs a restart.
- **Per-weblog** (`Weblog` columns, Weblog Settings) and **per-entry**.
- **Environment** (`ROLLER_*`): highest precedence
  (`WebloggerConfig.applyEnvironmentOverrides`): strip `ROLLER_`, lowercase,
  `_` → `.`. A case-insensitive match on an existing key writes to its
  spelling (`ROLLER_DATABASE_JDBC_DRIVERCLASS` →
  `database.jdbc.driverClass`); an unmatched name is used as derived —
  required, since `mail.port` has no entry in `roller.properties` and
  `uploads.dir` is commented out. Production is configured this way.
- **A `ROLLER_*` variable for a *runtime* property reaches only the static
  layer.** `WebloggerRuntimeConfig.getProperty`/`getIntProperty` read the DB
  row alone, and a runtime row exists with its (often blank) default, so the
  variable is silently ignored unless the reader uses
  `getPropertyWithConfigFallback` (non-blank row, else static) or
  `getBooleanProperty`. A saved non-blank row beats the variable. Shipped
  once: `getAbsoluteContextURL()` read only the row, so
  `ROLLER_SITE_ABSOLUTEURL` never reached generated urls and they took the
  first request's host (fixed 2026-10-10, `WebloggerRuntimeConfigTest`,
  `SeoControllerTest.robotsAdvertisesTheEnvironmentSiteUrl...`). Tests set
  the static layer with `StaticConfigOverride` (restores on close).

**Promoting a startup property to runtime** (add a `<property-def>`, read via
`WebloggerRuntimeConfig`) has three traps, pinned by
`PromotedRuntimePropertyTest`:
1. The defaults in both files must match.
2. The DB row wins once it exists, so seeding must take the *startup* value
   (`JPAPropertiesManagerImpl.initialValueFor`) or an upgrade discards the
   deployer's value.
3. The call site must genuinely re-read it: not a `static final`
   (`WeblogEntry`'s anchor separator was one) or a value latched in `init()`.

Promoted: `groupblogging.enabled`, `user.hideUserNames`,
`weblogentry.title.useUnderscoreSeparator` (`comment.throttle.enabled` went
with comments, W1). Throttle *sizing* (threshold/interval/maxentries)
sizes a fixed cache and stays startup-scoped; only the switch is hot.

**Deliberately NOT promoted** (decide first):
- `weblogAdminsUntrusted` — would put "disable HTML sanitization" on a
  form. (`passwds.encryption.enabled` is gone entirely; see Passwords.)
- `rememberme.enabled`, `themes.reload.mode`, `users.firstUserAdmin` —
  structurally boot-scoped.
- `search.enabled` — gates whether a Lucene index is built.
